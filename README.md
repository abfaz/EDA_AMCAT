# EDA Project AMCAT Data Analysis


## Objective
The dataset, sourced from Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO), focuses on engineering students and encompasses essential employment outcomes such as salary, job titles, and locations. With around 40 variables and 4000 data points, it includes a mix of continuous and categorical features, providing insights into cognitive, technical, and personality skills. 

The objective of the project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Aspiring Minds Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) dataset to:

• Gain insights into the employment outcomes of engineering graduates. 

• Understand the factors influencing salary expectations and specialization preferences among graduates. 

• Provide recommendations for optimizing recruitment strategies and improving graduate outcomes based on datadriven insights.
